Birdfood is a small web service that turns twitter searches or user feeds into atom feeds usable by any standard feed reading application.

Birdfood has a simple URL format:

For user feeds, use http://example.com/user/elad3 (replace elad3 with the relevant username)
for searches, use http://example.com/search/keyword (replace keyword with your search terms)

Birdfood is GPL.

Birdfood needs a simple config file to run. The following is an example for a birdfood config file (usually named birdfood.conf):

[birdfood]
consumer_key = blah blah blah
consumer_secret = blah blah blah

To use birdfood, you'll need a consumer key and consumer secret obtainable via https://dev.twitter.com/
When birdfood is first ran after adding these values to the config file, it will request you to authenticate with twitter. If you already have done so in the past, add the token and token_secret keys to the config file with the relevant values.

It is recommended that the first run of birdfood will be done via CLI and not any server script, to make sure it's working correctly.
